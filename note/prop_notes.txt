Rule of thumb: 2" pitch = 400 RPM

Definitions:
--

Pitch: theoretical distance the prop travels on each rotation. This is theoretical because water is not a solid medium and the prop slips. 10 to 30% is normal, the lower numbers are found only on hi-performance props, specially prepared. 

Transom = stern = rear = aft-most
