Abstract:
    In this paper, modeling approaches for quantization and colored noises have
    been proposed. To accommodate the quantization noise, a modified inertial
    navigation system (INS) error dynamics is developed in this paper, and the
    quantization noise is incorporated into the modified INS error dynamics as
    augmenting driving noise. The three kinds of colored noises are modeled by
    using an equivalent differential equation driven by a unit white noise, and a
    technique is developed in this paper to augment the Kalman Filter of GPS/INS
    integration using this equivalent differential equation. Experimental test
    results show that the proposed stochastic error modeling approaches for
    quantization and colored noises significantly improves the accuracies of the
    estimated inertial drifts and the navigation solutions.
