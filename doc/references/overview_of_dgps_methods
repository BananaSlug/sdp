Abstract: 
    A local GPS reference receiver (RR) can be used to eliminate common errors
    in the GPS navigation solution of other nearby receivers. A threefold
    improvement in remote GPS position accuracy can be achieved by this technique
    under optimum conditions. Several methods of accomplishing this process are
    presented.
