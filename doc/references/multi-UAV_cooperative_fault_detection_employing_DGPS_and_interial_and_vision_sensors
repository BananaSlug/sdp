Abstract:
    This paper presents a method to increase the reliability of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) sensor Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) in a multi-UAV
    context. Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and inertial sensors are
    used for sensor FDI in each UAV. The method uses additional position
    estimations that augment individual UAV FDI system. These additional
    estimations are obtained using images from the same planar scene taken from two
    different UAVs. Since accuracy and noise level of the estimation depends on
    several factors, dynamic replanning of the multi-UAV team can be used to obtain
    a better estimation in case of faults caused by slow growing errors of absolute
    position estimation that cannot be detected by using local FDI in the UAVs.
    Experimental results with data from two real UAVs are also presented.
