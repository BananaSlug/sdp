Abstract:
    This study presents the operation basis of GPS global positioning system
    and augmentation systems used to increase positioning accuracy. Furthermore,
    selected measurement results for an EGNOS-augmented GPS receiver positioning
    are included along with an analysis of GIS measurements accuracy, performed
    using differential corrections. This analysis takes into consideration the
    impact of the number of measurement series and satellite constellation on the
    accuracy of positioning achieved in praxis using the EGNOS system.  Accession
