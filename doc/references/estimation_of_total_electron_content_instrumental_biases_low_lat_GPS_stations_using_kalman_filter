Abstract:
    In order to achieve the required navigation accuracy for satellite based
    augmentation system (SBAS) applications, the ionospheric total electron content
    (TEC) must be accurately estimated. However, measurements of TEC from the
    Global Positioning System (GPS) observables are corrupted by instrumental delay
    biases of satellites and receiver, measurement noise and multipath errors. In
    this investigation, an algorithm based on the Kalman filter is developed for
    the estimation of TEC and instrumental biases, using single station data in
    contrast to multi-station technique reported elsewhere. The initial state of
    receiver bias in the Kalman filter is chosen using a modified fitted receiver
    bias (FRB) method. The estimated instrumental biases for several equatorial and
    low latitude stations in the International GNSS Service (IGS) and GPS Aided Geo
    Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) network show significant improvement.
